# My-Coding-Portfolio

## Description

This web application was designed to create a space to compile projects throughout the bootcamp. As I gorw and learn, more and more will be added to this portfolio so I can display my work in one central location. This will also allow others to find out more about me and how to contact me. It is a foundation that I can work from, and continue to adjust as I learn.

## Installation

Simply deploying the web application will get things going.

## Usage

In this application, the links in the navigation bar, and "my work" and "contact me" sections are all functional. More wil be included under My Work as time goes on. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
